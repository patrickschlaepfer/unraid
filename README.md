## Copy files from USB disk to unRAID

The unassigned disk will usually mount to /mnt/disks/ folder so if in the unraid gui you enter the console (top right) and do a

    $ cd /mnt/disks/
    $ ls

That should be your disk.  So for example if I have a folder called movies on my usb drive and a share called movies on my array, I want to copy from my usb drive to my array I would use this:

    cp -av /mnt/disks/WD_Book/Movies /mnt/user/Movies

copy files and directorys and list items copied from my usb drive to my movies directory on my array.

## Enable NFS

## Enable array autostart

To enable the array to start automatically when the server is rebooted, go to the settings tab and click on Disk Settings. Then, where it says Enable auto start, change it to Yes, and then click on Apply. Now, anytime the server is rebooted, you wonâ€™t have to enable the array manually. It will be done automatically. Any Docker container and virtual machines will also start automatically after the array starts.

## Shutdown/Reboot

unraid stop the array before it proceeds to shut down
